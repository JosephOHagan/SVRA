# SteamVR Assistant 
The SteamVR Assistant is a Unity toolkit for assisting developers creating VR applications using Unity and SteamVR. It aims to help streamline the development process and make VR development more accessible to new developers.

Note: No Vive connected - openapi errors (due to lack of Vive)

# Some Instructions (I'll make a PDF version sometime)
Coming soon
